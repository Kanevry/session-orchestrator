## [2.0.0-alpha] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- quality-gates reference skill — canonical commands for typecheck, test, lint with 4 variants (Baseline, Incremental, Full Gate, Per-File)
- 9 new Session Config fields: test-command, typecheck-command, lint-command, ssot-freshness-days, plugin-freshness-days, recent-commits, issue-limit, stale-branch-days, stale-issue-days
- Role-to-wave mapping table — waves dynamically map to 5 roles (Discovery, Impl-Core, Impl-Polish, Quality, Finalization) based on configured wave count (3-6+)
- discovery skill with /discovery command — systematic quality audit with 22 probes across 5 categories (code, infra, ui, arch, session)
- 4 new Session Config fields for discovery: discovery-on-close, discovery-probes, discovery-exclude-paths, discovery-severity-threshold

### Changed
- gitlab-ops is now the single source of truth for all VCS operations — consuming skills reference it instead of duplicating commands (#11)
- Quality checks across all skills now reference quality-gates instead of hardcoding commands (#12)
- Session Config documentation consolidated — USER-GUIDE.md Section 4 is the authoritative field reference (#13)
- All hardcoded thresholds (SSOT freshness, plugin age, stale branches, etc.) are now configurable via Session Config (#14)
- Wave execution model rewritten from hardcoded wave numbers to role-based assignment (#15)
- Pencil design review triggers now reference Impl-Core and Impl-Polish roles instead of Wave 2/3
- Label taxonomy in CONTRIBUTING.md and USER-GUIDE.md now points to gitlab-ops as SSOT

### Removed
- ~80 lines of duplicated VCS detection/command logic across 4 skills
- ~30 lines of duplicated quality check commands across 4 skills
- ~60 lines of duplicated Session Config documentation across 3 files
- All hardcoded "Wave 1/2/3/4/5" references in favor of role names

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- 3 commands: /session, /go, /close
- 1 agent: session-reviewer (inter-wave quality gate)
- SessionStart hook with startup notification
- Soul personality system (soul.md)
- VCS auto-detection with dual GitLab + GitHub support
- 5-wave execution pattern with configurable agent counts
- Inter-wave Pencil design-code alignment reviews
- Ecosystem health monitoring (service endpoints + cross-repo scanning)
- Session Config system with 13 configurable fields
